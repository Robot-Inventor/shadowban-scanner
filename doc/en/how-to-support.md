# How you can help develop Shadowban Scanner

Shadowban Scanner is a hobby project of the author, but it takes a lot of time to develop and operate. If you can afford it, I would appreciate it if you could support its development.

Also, just following [the author's Twitter account](https://x.com/keita_roboin) will motivate me to develop. If you are familiar with programming or would like to help with translation, please participate in the development on [GitHub](https://github.com/Robot-Inventor/shadowban-scanner/)!
