## Accuracy

When it comes to detecting shadowbans on an account level, like many other tools, there can be instances of false positives and false negatives. However, when it comes to detecting sensitive flags and age restrictions on a tweet level, it can be almost perfectly accurate. Therefore, it is recommended to use Shadowban Scanner to continuously monitor the status of your account and tweets, while also utilizing other tools alongside it.

## Detection Methods
