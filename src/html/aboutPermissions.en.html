            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In order to accommodate Twitter (X) specification changes, the next update of Shadowban Scanner will
                    <b>add required permissions</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Permissions are added, but <b>nothing substantive changes</b>.
                    <b
                        >The functionality that had stopped working due to Twitter's specification changes will simply
                        be restored</b
                    >
                </li>
                <li>
                    Within a few days, a dialog will appear in your browser asking if you agree to add permissions,
                    <b>please agree</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Agreement is not required</b>, but due to browser specifications,
                    <b>if you do not agree, you will not be able to update Shadowban Scanner</b>
                </li>

            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>
                Within a few days, a Shadowban Scanner will display a dialog in your browser asking you to approve
                additional permissions. Please approve the permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason why additional permissions are required is to accommodate changes in Twitter specifications.
                Details are explained in the following explanation.
            </p>
            <h3>Why do it need new permissions?</h3>
            <p>
                In order to accommodate Twitter (X) specification changes, the next update of Shadowban Scanner will add
                <b>required permissions</b>. Until now, the following host permissions were used.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>https://twitter.com/*</li>
                <li>https://mobile.twitter.com/*</li>
                <li>https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/*</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This means that Shadowban Scanner will be loaded and work with the above URLs. These are the URLs for
                Twitter and TweetDeck.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, due to recent changes in Twitter specifications, the URL of TweetDeck (X Pro) has changed.
                <b>Shadowban Scanner can only work with the above URLs, so it no longer works with TweetDeck. </b>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, in the next update, I will change the host privileges as follows</p>
            <ul>
                <li>https://*.twitter.com/*</li>
                <li>https://*.x.com/*</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This means that Shadowban Scanner will have access to all Twitter URLs, including the new TweetDeck URL.
                x.com is included to accommodate Twitter's future URL changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b
                    >After changing the permissions, Shadowban Scanner will still only be enabled on Twitter and
                    TweetDeck</b
                >. It's no longer enabled on Twitter's help page, etc., so it's essentially no different than before.
                <b>Things that stopped working due to specification changes will simply return to normal.</b>
            </p>
            <h3>What happens if you don't approve the permissions?</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Approving permissions is not required</b>, but due to browser specifications,
                <b>failure to approve permissions will prevent you from updating Shadowban Scanner</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a browser specification and there is nothing I can do about it. I have looked for other ways,
                but this is the only way I could find.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Is it not possible to ask for additional permissions only for those who want to use it in TweetDeck?
            </h3>
            <p>
                No I can't, to support TweetDeck I would have to ask for permissions with all Shadowban Scanner users.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be precise, we used to be able to do so, but due to changes in browser specifications (introduction
                of Manifest V3), it is no longer possible. I hope you understand this.
            </p>
